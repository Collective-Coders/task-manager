# Task Manager

## Brief

For this project, we'll be creating a webpage that will be able to list out tasks that we need to do.  The user of the webpage will be able to create 'tasks' and view multiple tasks at a time, all on the
same screen, and visually sort through the tasks.

Eventually, the webpage will be integrated with a personal server that has a database and individual user accounts.  Then, we will be able to log onto our accounts, create tasks for ourselves, and save our progress on tasks in our lives.

The work for this project will be split between the members of this group.

### Demencio

Demencio, your role in this project will be in creating the webpage and adding the features into that webpage. You will be responsible for building a **dynamic** webpage. For now, you'll be handling the **front-end** operations.

### Max

My role in this project will be to handle the server stuff.  While you are building the webpage and it's logic, I'm going to build our personal server and hook it up to a database for us. For now, I'll be handing the **back-end** operations.
